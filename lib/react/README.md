# Memento

Memento is Flexible and easy unidirectional store-pattern container for state management with Dependency Injection for Frontend app on JS/TS.

You can define stores inspired by MVU patterns such as Flux and Elm to observe state changes more detail.

Some are inspired by Elm and MVU.
And Redux and Flux pattern are same too, but memento is not Redux and Flux.
